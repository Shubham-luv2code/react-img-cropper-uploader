# react-img-cropper-uploader
This project deals with an image upload of predefined size and modifies into four different type of sizes with the help of react-image-cropper npm module and saves the cropped image to mongoDB and google firebase hosting servers and fetches the same to be diplayed on UI.

Commmands to run the project:
npm install in both my-app(frontend) and server-app(backend)
npm run dev - It'll concurrently run the backend express server on localhost:5000 and UI react-scripts localhost:3000

Once the server is started run mongod.exe in your local and use the UI for cropping purpose.
